# FriendFinder

this app is called FriendFinder, is an app where you can match with other users.

I used nodejs with express to build this app.

there is a link to the app: [Friend Finder](https://mouhoubfriendfinder.herokuapp.com/).

you have to take a survey, and the app will display your match in popup window (modal), with the name of your match and a picture. like in this pictures.
